<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm  Luis Felipe</h1>
<h3 align="center">"I'm a passionate Economics student at UNICAMP, with a keen interest in macro and microeconomics. </h2> I'm dedicated to exploring the application of data analysis in the field, using powerful tools like Python and R to study economic phenomena.

My ultimate goal is to work at the intersection of data science and economics, applying my skills to gain insights and make informed decisions. I'm driven by a deep curiosity and love for learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise.</h2>

I believe that the combination of economic theory and data-driven analysis holds tremendous potential. Through my projects and studies, I strive to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that contribute to a better understanding of economic dynamics.

I'm particularly excited about connecting with professionals in the field, including those in HR and the job market. I'm eager to contribute my skills and insights to real-world challenges and collaborate on meaningful projects.</h2>

Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of data-driven economics together!"</h3>
